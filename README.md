## 3D rendering with C++, OpenGL, and GLFW

A 3D demonstration of using OpenGL and GLFW with C++ to render a scence of custom textured cubes with key and mouse input to view the scene.

Utilizes matices, vectors, and shaders to deliver the final result.

Also features key callback and mouse input to view the scene manually using GLFW and a camera projection matrix.

Written in C++ to harness the best optimizations of the library in the future.

For image loading, the great and simple SOIL library is used to extract ".png" files from the directory.

Uses a few basic shaders written in the OpenGL shading language, GLSL.

## Code

Display, Shader, and main.cpp is where the bulk of the content is at.

## Usage

Feel free to incorporate the code and shader files in your own code examples.

Note: although it has been commented amply to provide guidance, it requires a basic understanding of OpenGL rendering concepts such as shaders.
